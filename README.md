# bQuit
Logout Macro &amp; Auto Quit

This Plugin is a newer Auto Quit that is able to determine if the player is CI, is Low-Life, or Life based, and quit based on a percentage you desire around that.
There is no need to set multiple values for ES and Life anymore.

Currently the plugin is set to 40%, which you can modify in the code yourself before compiling, which I would suggest. I will add a sliding bar later.
Also, the debug will let you know what is being taken into consideration for auto quit.

ToDo:

Implement an advanced flask manager.
